## Introduction

Codext, contraction of "*codecs*" and "*extension*", is a tiny library that gathers a few additional encodings for use with [`codecs`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html). While imported, it registers new encodings to a proxy codecs registry for making the encodings available from the `codecs.(decode|encode|open)` calls.

### Setup

This library is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/codext/) and can be simply installed using Pip:

```sh
pip install codext
```
